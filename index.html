                        Schumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit
                         for sustained periods.[9] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regime and ability to galvanise teams around him.
                        [10][11] In 2003, Motor Sport author Christopher Hilton observed that a "measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races,
                         because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed", and noted that like other great drivers,
                         Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes:
                         up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[12] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions,
                          earning him the nicknames "Regenk√∂nig" (rain king)[13] or "Regenmeister" (rain master),[9] even in the non-German-language media.
                         He is also known as "the Red Baron", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German <a  target="_blank" class="german" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_von_Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, the famous
